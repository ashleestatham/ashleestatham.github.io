    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello and Welcome! I’m Ashlee, a data science professional interested in using
        data to better understand people, systems, and social patterns. I’m
        especially interested in how data science can be applied in
        interdisciplinary contexts, including social science, policy,
        technology, and ethical decision-making. Outside of my work, I enjoy
        spending time with my family, traveling, cars, and cheering on my favorite
        sports teams.

        This website will grow throughout the semester as I develop new technical
        skills, complete projects, and reflect on what I’m learning.

        <h3>Why Learning Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters</h3>
        <div class="meta">Published: January 2026 | 4 min read</div>

        <p>
            Learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters
            because data is not just numbers — it represents people, behaviors, and
            real-world outcomes.
        </p>

        <div id="post1" class="extra-content">

            <p>
                Modeling social topics and people allows us to better understand patterns that are often invisible at the individual level, such as inequality and access to resources. When used correctly, data science can have a positive and powerful impact on public policy, healthcare, education, and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, working with data about people comes with significant responsibilities. Data is rarely neutral, and the way it is collected, modeled, and interpreted can sometimes create biases and/or overlook important context. As someone learning data science, I often think about ethical responsibilities such as protecting privacy, avoiding harmful assumptions, and being transparent about limitations in data and models. Understanding who is represented — and who is not — is just as important as building accurate models.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason interdisciplinary learning matters is because social problems cannot be solved through technical skills alone. Data science benefits from perspectives in sociology, psychology, ethics, and public policy. Without these perspectives, it’s easy to misinterpret results or apply models in ways that cause harm. For that reason, learning to ask thoughtful questions is just as important as learning how to code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through my DTSC Studio II course, I’m hoping to better understand how data science tools can be used to explore social questions responsibly and thoughtfully. I want to develop both technical skills and critical thinking skills so that I can analyze data in a way that respects the people involved. Ultimately, my goal is to use data science not just to find patterns, but to contribute to more informed and ethical decision-making.

        <h3>Social Determinants of Health and the Capabilities Approach</h3>
        <div class="meta">Published: February 2026 | 5 min read</div>

        <p>
            When thinking about health, the first thing I picture is hospitals,
            doctors, and medications. However, most of what shapes our health
            happens long before we enter a clinic.
        </p>

        <div id="post2" class="extra-content">
            <!-- Full original text preserved -->
            <p>
                During this Data Science Studio II course, I have learned quite a bit about the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). I found out that SDOH are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. With this new information, I personally define SDOH as general everyday circumstances that quietly structure our chances of living a healthy life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take housing for instance. A child growing up in a damp, overcrowded home is much more likely to develop asthma. Or, consider employment as another example. Someone with a secure job making fair pay is likely to have a lower stress level than someone who is experiencing the opposite. Something else to consider in this example is that the person with the secure job and fair pay is much more likely to be capable of buying nutritious foods than their counterpart as well. There are so many daily factors that quietly affect our quality of life, such as: neighborhood safety, education, social inclusion, community resources, etc. While none of these factors are considered “medical”, they still play a powerful role in who has the luxury of leading a healthy life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Capabilities Approach, on the other hand, shifts the focus from what people have to what they are actually able to be and do. In my opinion, it asks if people have the freedom to live the kind of life they value and aspire. It’s honestly not just about income but genuinely about the actual opportunities at hand. An example of this would be, two people that both have access to a public park. If one person works three jobs, they never have free time to visit the park while the person with one job typically has a much better chance of finding free time. The person with three jobs has limited capability to enjoy recreational activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                When comparing the SDOH and the Capabilities Approach, the connection seems to occur when looking at the social conditions that shape people’s freedom. Factors such as unsafe neighborhoods, poor housing, and discrimination don’t just increase risk of disease, but they also lower a person’s capabilities. They put a serious limit on one’s ability to be healthy, participate in everyday society, pursue higher education, or just feel secure. In other words, the SDOH are the base in which capabilities either grow or they don’t.

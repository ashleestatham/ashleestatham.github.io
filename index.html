        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello and Welcome! I’m Ashlee, a data science professional interested in using
            data to better understand people, systems, and social patterns. I’m
            especially interested in how data science can be applied in
            interdisciplinary contexts, including social science, policy,
            technology, and ethical decision-making. Outside of my work, I enjoy
            spending time with my family, traveling, cars, and cheering on my favorite
            sports teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website will grow throughout the semester as I develop new technical
            skills, complete projects, and reflect on what I’m learning.

            <h3>
                Why Learning Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters
            </h3>
            <p><em>Published: January 2026</em></p>

            <p>
                Learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters
                because data is not just numbers — it represents people, behaviors, and
                real-world outcomes. Modeling social topics and people allows us to
                better understand patterns that are often invisible at the individual
                level, such as inequality and access to resources. When used correctly,
                data science can have a positive and powerful impact on public policy,
                healthcare, education, and technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, working with data about people comes with significant
                responsibilities. Data is rarely neutral, and the way it is collected,
                modeled, and interpreted can sometimes create biases and/or overlook
                important context. As someone learning data science, I often think
                about ethical responsibilities such as protecting privacy, avoiding
                harmful assumptions, and being transparent about limitations in data
                and models. Understanding who is represented — and who is not — is just
                as important as building accurate models.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another reason interdisciplinary learning matters is because social
                problems cannot be solved through technical skills alone. Data science
                benefits from perspectives in sociology, psychology, ethics, and public
                policy. Without these perspectives, it’s easy to misinterpret results
                or apply models in ways that cause harm. For that reason, learning to
                ask thoughtful questions is just as important as learning how to code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through my DTSC Studio II course, I’m hoping to better understand how
                data science tools can be used to explore social questions responsibly
                and thoughtfully. I want to develop both technical skills and critical
                thinking skills so that I can analyze data in a way that respects the
                people involved. Ultimately, my goal is to use data science not just to
                find patterns, but to contribute to more informed and ethical
                decision-making.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello and Welcome! I’m Ashlee, a data science professional interested in using
        data to better understand people, systems, and social patterns. I’m
        especially interested in how data science can be applied in
        interdisciplinary contexts, including social science, policy,
        technology, and ethical decision-making. Outside of my work, I enjoy
        spending time with my family, traveling, cars, and cheering on my favorite
        sports teams.

        This website will grow throughout the semester as I develop new technical
        skills, complete projects, and reflect on what I’m learning.

        <h3>Why Learning Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters</h3>
        <div class="meta">Published: January 2026 | 4 min read</div>

        <p>
            Learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters
            because data is not just numbers — it represents people, behaviors, and
            real-world outcomes.
        </p>

        <div id="post1" class="extra-content">
            <p>
                Modeling social topics allows us to understand patterns that are often invisible
                at the individual level, such as inequality and access to resources.
                When used correctly, data science can positively impact public policy,
                healthcare, education, and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, working with data about people comes with responsibilities.
                Data is rarely neutral, and how it is collected and interpreted can create bias.
                Protecting privacy, avoiding harmful assumptions, and acknowledging limitations
                are essential responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interdisciplinary learning matters because social problems require more than
                technical skills. Perspectives from sociology, psychology, ethics, and public
                policy are critical to responsible analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through DTSC Studio II, I aim to strengthen both technical and critical thinking
                skills so I can use data science to contribute to ethical and informed
                decision-making.

        <h3>Social Determinants of Health and the Capabilities Approach</h3>
        <div class="meta">Published: February 2026 | 5 min read</div>

        <p>
            When thinking about health, the first thing I picture is hospitals,
            doctors, and medications. However, most of what shapes our health
            happens long before we enter a clinic.
        </p>

        <div id="post2" class="extra-content">
            <p>
                During Data Science Studio II, I learned about the Social Determinants
                of Health (SDOH), defined as the conditions in which people are born,
                grow, live, work, and age. I now see SDOH as everyday circumstances
                that quietly structure our chances of living a healthy life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Housing, employment, neighborhood safety, education, and social inclusion
                all shape health outcomes. A child in damp housing may develop asthma.
                Someone with stable employment is more likely to afford nutritious food
                and experience lower stress levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Capabilities Approach shifts focus from what people have to what
                they are able to be and do. It asks whether people truly have the
                freedom to live the life they value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comparing SDOH and the Capabilities Approach shows that social
                conditions shape people’s capabilities. Unsafe neighborhoods,
                poor housing, and discrimination limit not only health outcomes,
                but also freedom, opportunity, and participation in society.
                SDOH form the foundation on which capabilities either grow or
                are constrained.
            </p>
